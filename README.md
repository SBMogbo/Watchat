# Unit 21: React Week 2

## Overview

In the previous unit, we built and deployed our first static React application to GitHub Pages. In this unit, we will integrate React as the View layer into a full-stack web application using the MVC paradigm and deploy it to Heroku. The stack we will work with is known as MERN, short for MongoDB Express React and Node.

## Key Topics

* React Router
* Lifecycle methods
* MERN
* Proxy
* AJAX calls

## Comprehension Check

You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:

1. What is required to work with a MERN application in a development environment?
2. What is React Router doing in the context of an SPA?
3. How does one configure a MERN application for deployment to a production environment?

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:

* Explain the importance and use of React lifecycle methods
* Explain and identify the pros and cons of React Single-Page Applications
* Implement React Router for conditional rendering of components
* Configure a proxy server for local development of a MERN application
* Implement MVC paradigm in a MERN application
* Distinguish the differences between a Container Component and a Presentational Component
* Successfully configure and deploy a MERN application to Heroku

## Homework: Google Books Search

* In this activity, you'll create a new React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment requires you to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.
